PROJECT TITLE: Warehouse Management System
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: University Project for OOP
VERSION or DATE: 14/06/25
AUTHORS: Rafael Barros Parigi
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Have Java 21 installed. Then cd into WarehouseManagementSystem folder and run the command ./run-warehouse.command.
HOW TO USE: 
- Under the Suppliers panel, you can add/update and delete suppliers. Once supplier orders have been created, you can visualise them by clicking on the supplier's name. Clicking on a supplier's name also allows you to check their phone number and id.
- Under the Inventory panel, you can add new products to the inventory catalogue, set initial stock and minimal stock for alert levels. You can return to this panel to check product stock.
- Under the Orders panel, you can create customer orders and stock delivery invoices. Once a new order is created, new items (or invoice lines) can be added before processing the invoices. You'll be alerted if any of the products in the invoice is not part of the inventory catalogue, or if there's not enough stock of any of the products. There are also alerts set up in case the product gets below the minimal stock threshold after an invoice is processed. 
- Under the reports tab, you can generate reports for sales revenue, net income and stock purchases.
